# Fantasy Premier League mini-league viewer

Code which imports mini-league data from the fantasy premier league and tabulates it using "prettytable".

The FPL websites limits the number of teams on a single page to 50. The advantage of this code is that you can select how many pages you want to view at once, with detailed information.

Included columns are

* Rank
* Last Rank
* Team Name
* Gameweek Points
* Bench Points
* Gameweek Transfers
* Cost (Transfer Hits)
* Total Transfers
* Team Value
* In The Bank
* Total Value
* Captain
* Vice Captain
* What chips have been used
* Team ID

The code is meant to be used in an IDE.
